I once held shorts at aug peaks, it was nightmare, one of the worst mental situations I have been in, I never want to experience that again. Find your breaking point and then aim about it, usually when you are pushed to max despair the market turns.

I read She Comes First this year. It was a very informative book and expanded my ability to think about relationships and intimacy rather well.

I've been wondering why the hell it was taking so long to close on my house but figured it was just due to increased volume because of the low rates and all the refis happening.

Turns out the person my lender hired to do the appraisal never fucking did it and kept saying he would send them the report any day now. It's been a goddamn month.

Anyway, they're getting someone else and reporting that guy to the appraisal board. What a shit head.

Didn't buy any longer term DIS calls today because I got greedy in the morning and was waiting for a dip which never came and by the time it was up 15% I couldn't justify buying anything.

Will go long on the next red day if that ever comes.

18 months with the Russians is a long time. I think youd find most of Camus a quick read after Dostoyevsky

Most of mine are books like Last Child in the Woods by Richard Louv and other books about nature play for childhood development. 

I started an IG account in May about dad-life and ended up finding a cool community of intentional parents. Its been pretty inspiring.

I never got to do a trip that long, but we prioritize travel and experiences, and weve made some big financial trade-offs for time. For our family its a trade Id make again without hesitation.

My wife is a doctor and Im an engineer. She tried the high pay high stress partnership deal and we were both unhappy despite the great money. We decided to earn ~50-60% of our salary potential in exchange for lots of time off, lots of flexibility, low stress, and high job stability. Essentially enjoying our time together instead of stepping up to an even nicer lifestyle. She works 40 hours a week (4x10s day shift with no strings) and I work 20. We take time off 6-8 weeks a year. We really like it. We have a big beautiful home with a nice view instead of a huge gorgeous house with a killer view. I have old Porsches instead of new ones, and we have time to spend at home, traveling, and pursuing hobbies. 

It seems like everyone needs to earn enough to be comfortable and pursue interests/hobbies, but after that, there quickly comes a point where more money primarily gives upgrades, yet not much in terms of new kinds of experiences. Staying at a nicer lodge on the same ski trip and that sort of thing. Thats the point where trading time and money should be considered more carefully - often the time is worth more.

Depends on whether you see your car as a utility or a fun thing.
 
I prefer to drive a new car. I lease my car and upgrade every two years. It comes down to about $400 a month and I also dont have to worry about maintenance or oil change. 
I could see the argument for the car just being a utility and driving it until it dies.
-------------------------------

So glad there's an indicator that tells me if the market gonna go up or down

Yea, for sure. You would learn so much. Unless you are making 275k- 550k trading your own account, I think its worth it to try the job out for at least a year or so.

Dude the camera.... how good is that shit

Thank you!

Always interested in what others are reading

That would be wild. I kinda hope they do secede. Cali would probably follow suit shortly after.

&gt; The New York Times reports that the FBI reviewed a laptop and an external hard drive that Trump allies said belonged to Hunter Biden and found nothing to advance a federal investigation of Biden.

Yes indeed. I see where youre coming from, I also know how the ties do run deep. I mean (Im not saying what she did was comparable Im just using this for sake of my point) but you had Hillary run again Trump, and she got caught up doing some borderline illegal, maybe it was illegal, shit with her emails and files etc. trump ran on a platform saying he would jail her for what she did....... nothing ever came of it... nothing. And he was president for 4 years.....


If you make the market, Ill take the other end of your trade :D

Super interesting, thanks for sharing!

What's a quick way to test ideas like this? I've had a similar idea but, while I'm slow but OK at coding, I'm not really great at whipping up a prototype quick and dirty just to test things out. Data dump to Python? Excel? Some trading software platform's strategy UI?

Drove around to all the christmas tree lights for my niece. Had a pretty good time. I like how much effort some of these people put into something that they not only pay for but brings joy to others.

Best one was a train village spread out over an entire front lawn. Three trains with bridges and the works. Niece couldn't stop talking about it.

Might be better off just paying a guy. My guy does mine for $250

Youd expect the fuckers to remember how it went the first time a part of the country tried to secede. But then theyd have to be able to read a book.

Youre thinking too much about it.

That one girl on IG that was average looking that acts like a dog was making $100k+, probably $250k by now. As below, just gotta find your niche

nice. i also want a huge desk

Thanks. I think it works as a good focal point. Plus who needs a lot of drawers in 2020 anyway

Yeah, it doesn't work. The Fed can't say it because they've worked themself into an absurd situation where saying otherwise is banned because managing sentiment/expectation is now part of their mission.

Fed encourages bank lending by putting an iron strong bid for risk free assets, and the Fed Put was recently tested and confirmed to the tune of trillions. It's clearly absurd.

Hello everyone,

I want to graph a portfolio from 2015 to 2020, that uses the top 10 Spy holdings by markedcap and gets rebalanced every quater to see if this strategy is superior to just holding spy.

My problem is that I can't find old data that shows the top holdings of spy from the years of 2015 to now.

Do you know any research about this topic?

I don't want to rely on opinion but more on data.

Cutting edge tech has to be used at some point. And if its the best candidate for a covid vaccine then so be it. But dont tell me it was rushed because a genius discovered the right approach quickly. If you understand the tech, understand how the approach works, then you should be very optimistic about this like I am. And Im almost 100% certain any vaccine side effects are better than the unknown long term consequences of contracting covid. Im in the least at-risk demographic and covid kicked my ass. So yeah, vaccine or take your chances with covid.
-------------------------------

I currently have AAPL, CRSR, O, and AMAT all covered.

O sucks because the premium is nothing. I sell about 10% OTM every month. This gives you about $504 per year, which is approx. an 8% return while likely keeping shares and getting dividends.

AAPL the premiums are decent. Nothing great.

CRSR has great premiums as 30d IV &gt; 110%.

AMAT was decent, but I am losing my shares this week... and theyre gone a long way down 
-------------------------------

There has only been a very few vaccines that turned out bad.  Some didn't work but almost none produced problems for people.  They have been 99% beneficial.  The worst virus of all time, smallpox, is now extinct because one man tried a method to produce the very first vaccine.  Other than penicillin, virus vaccines have been the most important health impacts for both humans (and many of our animal partners).
-------------------------------

CA would be better off lol. Theyd have the 5th largest economy in the world and instead of contributing 15% of the total US fed income tax they could do socialized healthcare, lower their existing taxes, and seriously invest in infrastructure
-------------------------------
1
Even easier than that I would think because he most likely doesn't have to worry about any added because they wouldn't be anywhere near the top 10 in market cap. If he just used the top 100 right now and looked at their historical I'm sure the top 10 always fell within that. He only wants 5 years ago.

I've got around 20k I'd like to throw in some shares and do some CC on. Unfortunately, Merrill is an absolute turd and doesn't let you sell cash secured puts without calling them. Unable to do the wheel strategy, but can do 1/2 of it.

Putting in my resignation today as a stock trader. Made a couple rolex's on BTC this weekend, which is more of a 'market' than the traditional markets are by a mile.


With that in mind, there are a couple things to bring to the floor:


- We are going straight and directly to new ATHs

- Bear fucking will be unrivaled

- Not only are politicians, corporations, government all in circlejerk position like they have never been before

- But they are also all ready to giga fuck all poors and middle class

- Bc can keep inflation below 3% but keep their assets going up 100% every month with global dollar demand so high. It'd be easier if we just directly deposited money into all people who are a part of the 1%, since all of the printed money doesn't move around anyway.
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V


- Higher and higher we go
Where we stop no one knows

- Pretty soon your house will take 100 years of work at your wage for you to pay off

- Having a home will thus become proxy enslavement
- Also youll need to rent food
- Too expensive to eat so youll finance food, rent it from the food renters
- Those that dont will have soylent tubes that around the same price as water
- Stock market will go up 100% every year until all poors and middle class are dead or homeless
- Coca Cola fountains will be everywhere and a replacement for welfare
- McDonalds will be a tech company with an entirely robotic workforce. - Only the rich will be able to eat a Big Mac prepared entirely by robots in 1.37 seconds
- The poverty line for annual income will be $500,000/year

**This is the world you get if m1 does this for 5 more years, all because you couldn't handle a market crash and real recession for 1-2 years.**

u/BombaFett Hey homie, I've been working on your daily deviations script that you wrote a while ago and have been trying to modify it to include +/- weekly deviation as well but got stuck trying to follow your path.

Buy a decent 88 key (I recommend the Yamaha portable grand, &lt;1k) and learn music theory to the point that you can look up the chords to songs you like and jam along. This gets you conversational.

After that it's all about finding your voice and learning how to get the things in your head out, through a digital interface (skip straight to universal audio if serious), and into Ableton or whatever.

It's all just estimates as we don't know precisely. From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_trading it mainly mentions a 2019 study showing 92% on forex, and a 2013 study showing 85% for US stocks in 2012, though I've seen others around 2015-17 at 90% or above. There probably has been a big increase in the number of small retail traders, but whether they accounted for enough volume to significantly change it I'm not sure.

what does inherent mean? genetic make up? 

what if i am inherently better than others just because i define myself that way? some dude defined god few thousand years ago. now 3 billion people according to wikipedia worship what that definition entails. so what im saying is something is true if you make it true, as long as its within physics laws.

&gt; your life / your path, has given you a perspective others might not have been fortunate or unfortunate enough to have.

this kinda goes back to the problem of determinism. my choices (my life/path/fortune or lack of fortune) are result of my hard work or my genes or random circumstances? 

combination of all 3, but mostly my hard work, or mostly genes, or mostly random stuff?

if its my hard work, then i deserve the most credit here. making difficult choices requires pain, which most people avoid. i could have chosen the easy path but i chose the difficult path. i accepted the pain, so i deserve to have the position of being better than them. if this is the case, then i could say hey i'm better than these people, they should have known what i know. i paid a price. they didn't. they don't get to have free food. so they get none of my niceness.

if its genes, and if i seem to be better than people, well then i am better than people.. just because of genes. i don't deserve much credit here. bragging about being better than others just because you got lucky is being arrogant and would lead to probable ruin. if this is the case, then i could think like i'm better than these people just because i'm lucky. i don't deserve to be an asshole to them.

if its random circumstances, then you are right.

&gt; asshole out of merit

this sounds pretty funny

I have a cousin who is christian and fairly conservative. She isn't a fox news nutter, but that's the world she runs in.

You can also make some tweaks in the NVIDIA control panel that can boost performance.

Sounds like you got the vaccine one.  7 days after, you are probably immune now.  Dose 2 will not be as fun but it will be over in 24 to 36 hours.  Take the next one because dose 2 is probably what gives the long-term immunity.

For Stewie it is about timing, he has high probability set up but not always does it work out. 

You have to take his chart and put your own personal input as well and not just follow blindly. 

I have his watchlist on but I also curated a select fews to my own watchlist.  CRNC is a chart that I don't like so I won't include to my play but I would love to see how that chart evolves.

He has posts before his stickied WSB post from other subreddits such as /r/stocks talking about his 5+ years experience in the QF field. In his WSB post, he does split up some of the quant strategies into ones he has experience with and others which he said he didn't but other firms still do.

Either way, it's worth a read as the info is pretty good.  Currently stickied up at the top of WSB.

Arbitrage is based on price and volume in orderbooks, but it doesn't require prediction. 

With derivatives I can perform statistical arbitrage across volatility surfaces of related assets. I'm not predicting the price action of the underlying assets but I'm still finding avenues to be profitable.

I can also use reactionary strategies that develop with the position itself. A lot of people who are new to quant think a strategy is "Enter &gt; Exit", but you could run way more complicated strategies that are never fully "out" or the asset they trade. Just because I can't predict the future reliably, I can react to movements as they happen and find a way to take a 50% accuracy prediction model and turn it into a profitable strategy.

I've found that for the last year or so, stocks and bonds haven't worked against each other in the same way that they used to, I think there's so much cash sitting on the sidelines that that it's created a disconnect between bonds and equity as the money isn't flowing from one to the other, but from cash reserves into and out of the market.

Back from the island and looking forward to trading again. Will take it easy until Jan, but at least I'll have time to read TWS again and look at charts.

Passed my (challenging) Yachtmaster Offshore exam and sailing now feels like riding a bike to me. These past few weeks have been some of the best I've ever had. 

Don't like being back tbh. It's freezing cold, raining and everything's in lockdown. The island had less than 20 cases and everything was back to normal...which is why I'm moving to Tenerife in Feb/Mar. 

Will trade to make money and do yacht deliveries to the Med/Europe and Caribbean for fun. Once borders are open again, I want to do a few South Pacific sailing trips too. 

Trend is still long, but I don't buy into up gaps...so will likely relax a bit today and enjoy having a normal toilet again :)

~~Anyone invest in anything on Equity Zen? I think~~ u/hibernating_brain ~~has, but what happens when the company goes public?~~

&gt; When a company goes public, there are some procedural steps and legal requirements that must be followed. Generally, we will seek to unwind the EquityZen fund or series into which you invested and transfer a number of shares, equivalent to your pro rata ownership in the fund or series, to a brokerage account you designate.

Ok lot of questions, but I have spare time so I'll try to run through them all.  

For context, Yeah I came from software development, and it's still my primary job.  I just happened to stumble into statistics while working on data viz type of work, where I was responsible for getting the data scientists to run there analysis and share their work onto some centralized system, and make it all pretty with plots and what not (most of the jobs I've focused on have been doing software dev for ML type companies).  Anyway, saying all that because some of the struggles I've had as a trader might not be as applicable to you.  Also saying it because I never truly studied math (outside of a basic engineering degree), so I'm self taught on that front , meaning whatever skills you're currently lacking , I'm pretty sure can be learned on your own.  We can learn all this together, that's what makes this sub awesome :)

&amp;nbsp;

Going to link this here, since someone else mentioned it in TWS and I happened to bookmark it.  Explains the concepts of pairs trading much better than I can.  While this particular strategy has nothing to do with pairs, it uses some similar math, or if nothing else, can maybe help get you started on the intuition of how to begin creating a quantifiable strategy.

&gt;trigger without using a chart?

Correct, no charts are used at all.  The comment I made about me charting is that I use it to _verify_ my math looks correct, example of one I shared a while back.  Made this gist after some discussion with folks here, where I was trying to understand the different ways 2 platforms calculate their vwap indicators (Tradingview vs TT).  Out of those discussions, I was able to get a better intuitive understanding of the calculations; and even come up with a few variations - https://gist.github.com/jxm262/449aed7f3ce0919e57a1f0ad8c18a9d9#gistcomment-3367180


&gt; Did you take indicators you liked and reduce them to the math, then just verify with a chart that they worked

I guess in a way (ignoring charts) yeah you can kind of say that.  The main way I trade is through mean reversion and/or market making type stuff.  It's not completely random like you make out, I look for similar properties that can be applied across trading ideas.  ie:  find relationships between things, look for extremes, fade them -&gt; optimize them.  And/or short term order book imbalances, etc..

&gt; Did you use ML for this?

I mean it uses some regression statistics so I guess you could say it's technically ML.  Also I cross validate with different methods like K-folds.  So... kinda?  back when I was in college we just called it data mining though and to me it's still more just basic stats (not ML like pruning giant decision trees).  

&gt; Monte Carlo simulation on stuff and then boil it down to high probabilities?

Yeah I use gibbs sampling on some other strats, though tbh I'm still new to all the hardcore ML stuff and don't know if it's doing what I think it's doing :P  So, I'll deflect on this and say I hope MCMC sims can help , though I have a long way before I feel confident that I'm actually doing it right.

&gt; Also noticed your gig seems to be relatively short term (not that your flair clued me into anything), but did you ever try longer term stuff?

Yes good point.  I dunno why, I've just always focused on the shorter duration.  Just happen to find better predictive properties when I look at lower time frames; it intuitively makes sense, in real life, you can better guesstimate what's going to happen in the next 30 seconds as opposed to next 30 days right?  That said, sure I have some 'smart' investing type stuff where I just put retirement money away and let it accumulate.  Don't think there's a right or wrong answer on choosing the trade longevity, or maybe there is, I dunno.

Hard to say.  50 PE may be a tad high..  TSLA likes to say they're a tech/software company, but at the end of the day they need to manage supply chains, hold inventory, manufacture items, deal with long lead times, etc...  their business is not like your software/tech companies which write code and then license it at little to no cost to themselves.  Their business is not like FB, GOOG, or AMZN where they have a near monopoly and are expected to hold it forever.  Using your numbers, if you assume a PE of 15 (automotive sector), they're already valued a good bit above their 2025 earnings.  Now, I dont think their PE should be that low... but I dont think its a 50x either.  Even if it's fair valued to 2025 earnings, that still means it's overpriced today.  Just my 2c.

That's exactly what I've done with ES.  I just occasionally risk-off a bit if I feel a move has some momentum, I have alerts if there is some kind of massive drop or any of the VIX's move too much which could wind up putting me into liquidation territory, but that's down in the 2080 territory.

So far it's been pretty profitable, if not a bit boring.

Nice short! Im surprised its not down more. Its basically at Jan/Feb or May/June levels. 

Reading the transcript of the investor call &amp; they keep referring to the issue that came up = patient death.

I confess - I'm short. But! Earlier today while setting up shorts I thought "you know ALL_WORK_ALL_PLAY, how many times have you entered a position, had it run against you, hit your stop, and then had it reverse?"

So I thought about that. And I thought about that. And I thought about that and *finally* I cut my position size in half, set the other half as a limit order where my stop was, then moved my original stop (after doing some math).

I regret that I only did this on one of my short positions. Incidentally, that limit order got filled on the most recent spin of 'stimulus talks are going well'.

Now can we head back down? Or is this the night where I learn I need to ladder in/out of positions by doing that same process four times rather than just once?

Dunno...that's why I'm asking :D

My impression is that at current valuations and multiples, the market is already pricing *more* than perfect execution and outcomes across the board, and I'm not sure even an aggressive deal (1.2k or even 1.5k check, local gov support) would move the needle on getting those perfect 2021 and 2022 earnings. The two don't really seem that connected. Interest rates are here to stay, and we're already flooded with liquidity- which are the two other levers that are almost maxed out.
Just curious when that realization would come in...

The Fed bailed JP Morgan out in September 2019 when the repo market went haywire. We taxpayers bailed them out in April when the Fed started buying their bonds with our money. And now, as Congress bickers over much needed stimulus, JP Morgan announces $30B in buybacks.

Isn't the whole point of buying these high risk tech stocks to try and make outlandish gains?  Why then turn around and sell a CC on them?  Sure the premium might be nice, but at that point you're forfeiting the outlandish gains and but still have the exposure to outlandish risk should it tank.  I'm all for selling IV... but do it where you know what the expected returns and realized vol should be.  Might as well bet on a craps table.

INTC down on rumors that MSFT is following AMZNs lead by designing their own ARM server chips. This is just the start. A server is the new transistor, a data center is the new computer. AMZN and MSFT are vertically integrating their own computers, and itll eventually all be done with very little Intel Inside. These companies have deep pockets and massive upside, its going to happen. Most of the important work isnt even done on a CPU anymore - its all offloaded to specialized accelerators, hence NVDAs rise. This is bearish for AMD as well, except they own accelerators that are increasingly important to offset the aforementioned CPU losses, they have very little CPU share to lose, they have the better performing and better value products, and they have great leadership and execution that is 150% looking into ARM and remaining flexible on architecture fundamentals.

**Market:**	ESH21

**Date:**	18-Dec

**Attempted Direction:**	Down

**Rotation Factor:**	-10

**Range Extension:**	Buyer &amp; Seller (Outside day)

**Tails:**	Seller

**Buying/Selling Composite:**	Selling comp

**One-timeframing (D/W/M):**	Day: Outside bar, Week/Month: OTing up

**Comments:**	"Open was above value/in range and began with an open-test-drive where price tested above yesterday's RTH high (3717) before reversing and driving lower, leaving a large selling tail in A period. B period continued lower, tagging Wednesday's VPOC and establishing a wide IB range. D period saw some extension lower followed by an inside bar in E period. F period broke the one timeframing down, but G period couldn't get above the B period high (3702.5), causing an intraday poor high.

Price continued lower in H period with one timeframing down continuing until L period. L period was unable to test 12/15's single prints and was followed by an outsized, in-range buying spike in M period that reversed much of the day's selling. Price closed back within yesterday's narrow VA."

**Daily Volume:**	1.60m (higher)

**Volume Average (20):**	1.37m

**VA Placement (H/OL-H/L/OL-L/Unch):**	Lower

**VA Width (Wide/Avg/Narrow):**	Wide

**Directional Performance Relationship:**	Balancing, weak

**Comments:**	Value was established lower today, however the VA is wide and volume is spread fairly evenly throughout the day's range. This tells me that seller control today wasn't as strong as it first appeared and the close is evidence of this.

**Tomorrow's Expectation:**	"This week's composite profile is one timeframing higher with overlapping-higher value and a higher VPOC (3686.75). There is also a notable amount of volume transacted in the 3707-13ish area.

I am viewing today's action as a retest of the developing weekly VPOC (3686.75) followed by a rejection higher back to yesterday's established value. This is a good sign for buyers IMO as it 'covered' the virgin VPOC from Wednesday and found support at/below the composite HVN before reversing back to the highs.

Looking to next week, I will continue to hold a long bias with price acceptance above the Dec. VPOC (3660.5). Immediate upside target is 3732 and lofty target for the week is 3800 (although this isn't the expectation given the shorten holiday week). For sellers, they will need to build on today's early liquidation by attracting new sellers as price continues lower. The first target to the downside is the comp LVN at 3673, with the Dec. VPOC below that. If sellers can find acceptance below there, I will target the short-term balance high that began on 11/9 (3638)."

last quad witching price stayed in a tight ranger for 3 hours and then broke down, didn't stop till EOD

Interesting how this time price started trending down form the open, makes me biased to the upside, can see unfinished auction at the current lows and think current LOD won't hold, if that happens might go long if it looks like a good opportunity, but I also think IV will get crushed .

Cem Karsan doesn't expect an EOD sell off today.

Heart rate is a combination of oxygen saturation in your blood and the size of your blood vessels.  Heart rate will go up when you are using up that oxygen through exercise etc.  For a rest state, maybe your lungs aren't that efficient or you are just older or your blood vessels are clogged or you are drinking alcohol making your blood vessels larger.  There is no particular reason to get that resting heart rate down to a particular level.  It can work for 50 years at 90.  It is better to just be in good shape, not damage your lungs and not get your blood vessels clogged.  If all those are good and you are still at 80 at rest state, that is completely fine.  The thing works for 100 years at that number.

17 days off from work starts now, fuck yeah. I usually take this time off as my line of work is slow during this period, its nice to get slightly over 2 weeks off, feels much different than just a week off.

What an amazing year financially.. but what a bad year for my physical health. I lost my muscle gains and became overweight.

I was reading that the US Olympic rowing team posts the qualifying times that you need to pull on a C2 rower in order to be invited out for tryouts. 

Going to try and see if I can get a qualifying time in the 2k tomorrow 

Ive really never rowed in my life but I think I might try and set a personal goal on qualifying/ going to the olympics depending on how tomorrows time trial goes

you're thinking too small. The key is to find stocks with low volume that can be strongarmed using options. Once the gamma squeeze starts FOMO money will start flowing in. Much easier to get the momentum needed for a true squeeze up.

I am still working until the end of Jan, after that taking a year off from work. 


I mostly detox at my dad's house in Portland. There is no wifi. I have mobile data so no constant Reddit, Twitter, Brokers software on three monitors. 

Just books, my electronic suitcase (breadboard, Arduino, wires, resistors, etc) and hang out with my dads friends.

Man if this shit seems like a conspiracy call me one. Blatantly obvious more like, well motivated and systemic. 


Im not into aliens, Illuminati, or any of that garbage. 


Shit Im highlighting isnt any theory, its just how the system has been working for a bit. I hope you guys can recognize that. I consider myself a very analytical person and dont believe in much more than statistics.

If price on the underlying is $25, and there's heavy option volume on the monthlies 19C's on the bid, is that essentially a hedge on large quantity of shares that the owner doesn't want to sell but expects price to decline?

Either that or someone exiting a large quantity of their long ITM calls?

no way of knowing if it's an entry or exit?

$RSX...

/u/wiggz420 i think someone is trying to put on a large short Rusher trade re: Solarwinds.  Oil &amp; Gas sanctions of some sort.

Of course. Buy signals everywhere as banks rally alongside tech. Semiconductors gave us the first clue a few weeks ago, and now that the vaccine is rolling out, reopening plays have massive upside.

Blue skies ahead.

(But I sold so much today. I really need a pullback plz)

Finally back in the gym and into my second cycle on Jim Wendlers 5/3/1. Quit working out in Feb and have only been doing pull-ups, push ups, ab wheel. Im amazed my deadlift is already heavier than pre-pandemic. I guess my lats were  too weak before.

So I watched LOTR last night and it made me realize I've been pronouncing Palantir incorrectly.

I've been saying Pal-uhn-teer and it's actually Puhl-AN-teer. It actually seems as if everyone has been mispronouncing it.
