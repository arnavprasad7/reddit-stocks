The Super Duper Breakout - Smart people on this sub say that one must find one's "edge" and stick to it. Finding the following pattern on charts is my edge, although I'm still learning how to trade them effectively and efficiently. The most difficult part of trading these kinds of breakouts is determining the exit--that is, when to take profits.

The super duper breakout is an ascending triangle that is large and forms on the *weekly* and must lead to new all time high. Here are some samples of super duper breakouts I've found and traded (there are obviously others, but I haven't traded them).

[AMD](https://www.tradingview.com/x/bJOMKZm8/)

I find the entries difficult to time. And confirmation can be tricky too. I often look at Squeezemomentum and RSI for confirmation.

There are other breakouts on weeklies that look similar but don't qualify as super duper breakouts. Samples:

Week in Review: S&amp;P 500 +1.25%, Nasdaq +3.05%, Russell 2000 +3.05%, Dow +0.44% - Overview:

-	US equities finished higher this week. Sector performance was mixed with tech, consumer discretionary and materials the standouts. Energy came under pressure and communications services underperformed. Treasuries were weaker. The dollar index was down 1.1%. Gold gained 2.5%. WTI crude was up 5.4%. There were several developments behind the move though the path of least resistance still seems higher on the back of the usual suspects that have been in play since the coronavirus bottom in late March. Fiscal stimulus progress was in focus this week with Congress closing in on a ~$900B coronavirus relief bill. Vaccine progress was another tailwind with the first shots of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and the FDA on the verge of granting emergency use authorization for the Moderna candidate. The Fed was also a factor with the somewhat stronger than expected outcome-based guidance around its QE program and dovish SEP takeaways. However, there also continued to be concerns about stretched valuation, positioning and sentiment indicators. In addition, there were signs of the fallout from worsening coronavirus trends and accompanying restrictions in some key economic data this week, as well as select corporate updates.

Growth and momentum outperform:

-	Growth (IVW +2.0%) and momentum (MTUM +3.4%) plays tended to outperform value (IVE -0.6%) and cyclicals this week despite the progress on both coronavirus relief and vaccines. However, the vaccine developments were in line with expectations and the group does have better leverage to the monetary policy support theme, which was also in focus this week. Tech was a standout with AAPL +3.5% helped by a Nikkei report on an expected pickup in iPhone production to meet strong demand for the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max. Cloud software also rallied and while semis lagged the sector tape with the SOX +2.2%, they still did well and there was some focus on chip shortages (Reuters). AMZN +2.7% was a standout in consumer discretionary amid continued signs of strong e-commerce demand and the company-specific disruption theme (Business Insider). Materials outperformed with precious metals (GDX +4.3%) and global miners among the big gainers. Financials lagged with select regional banks and life insurers some of the drags. Industrials underperformed with transportation names mostly weaker. Communications services ended down with GOOGL (2.7%), the big tech name under the most antitrust scrutiny right now, a laggard. Energy put in the worst performance despite the strength in oil, which moved up for a seventh straight week.

Congress closing in on ~$900B coronavirus relief bill:

-	This week brought some meaningful progress toward an elusive fifth coronavirus relief bill. The package is expected to come in at ~$900B and feature $600 stimulus checks, $300 a week of additional unemployment benefits and ~$325B for small businesses. Billions in funding for vaccine distribution, education and healthcare are also expected to be part of the package, as is support for the airline industry. However, it will not include the two most contentious items, additional funding for state and local governments, which had been a priority for Democrats, and liability protections for businesses, which had been a red line for Republicans. Heading into the weekend, there were still a few stumbling blocks facing a deal, including a Republican push to explicitly terminate the Fed's emergency lending programs, a Democratic request to match 100% of FEMA payouts for the pandemic, the length of the additional unemployment benefits and stimulus check eligibility. There were also some concerns that the lack of additional state and local government funding could dampen the growth boost, as well as the potential for Republican control of the Senate (The Hill) to thwart any additional stimulus in 2021.

US rolls out Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, Moderna coming next:

-	Over the weekend, the FDA approved the vaccine from PFE (8.3%) and BNTX (18.1%) for emergency use and the first doses were administered on Monday. In addition, an FDA advisory committee on Thursday recommended that the vaccine from MRNA (10.6%) be cleared for use in people 18 years of age and older. The FDA is expected to quickly grant emergency use authorization for that vaccine as well. With both vaccines securing emergency use authorization, the US is expected to deliver enough first-round doses for 20M people by the end of the year. In addition, while there has been a pickup in concerns about a supply cliff this spring (Politico), Moncef Slaoui, the chief scientific adviser to Operation Warp Speed, said Thursday that the US is close to a deal for another 100M doses from PFE that would be delivered in the second quarter of 2021 (Bloomberg). Separately, Politico noted that the Trump administration anticipates that both JNJ +1.0% and AZN (7.5%) will seek emergency use authorization from the FDA for their shots by the end of February. That would mean the US would have four vaccines available, including the first to require just one jab, to meet its goal of immunizing 100M people by the end of March.

Fed meeting keeps focus on monetary policy tailwind:

-	As widely expected, the Fed provided some additional guidance around QE at this week's meeting. It noted that it would continue its monthly pace of asset purchases until it achieves "substantial further progress" towards its dual mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability. Neither the statement nor Fed Chair Powell provided any numerical thresholds. There were some thoughts that by explicitly committing to the current $120B monthly pace of asset purchases, guidance was somewhat stronger than expected. While the Fed did not announce a duration extension, only a minority expected it to do so and some economists have said this may be a more appropriate policy tweak when long-term rates start to see more meaningful upward pressure. There were also some dovish takeaways surrounding the updated Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). While the median projection for real GDP growth in 2021 and 2022 was revised up 0.2pp in both years to 4.2% and 3.2%, respectively, and inflation estimates also moved higher for the next two years (though only reaching 2.0% at the end of 2023), there was no shift in the outlook for ZIRP to continue through 2023.

More concerns that valuation, positioning and sentiment indicators look stretched:

-	BofA said that its December Global Fund Manager Survey revealed that optimism on "risk-on" assets (equities and commodities) has seen a significant increase to a net 69%, the highest since February 2011. It added that optimism on stocks, which now stands at a net 51%, is the highest since January 2018. It also noted that a net percentage of investors are underweight cash for the first time since May 2013, while cash levels slipped to 4.0% from 4.1%, triggering its FMS Cash Rule "sell signal". According to EPFR Global, global equities attracted a record $46.6B in the week-ended 16-Dec, while nearly $60B left money market funds, the most in four months. Reuters highlighted some concerns about elevated valuations with the S&amp;P 500 trading at 22x forward earnings, well ahead of the 15.3x historical average. It added that the tech sector is trading at 26.4x, nearly 6 points above its historical average. It also flagged concerns about the bubble-like behavior in Bitcoin (which surged over 25% this week), SPACs and a ~700% ytd rally in TSLA +7.9%, which is set to go into the S&amp;P 500 after the close. However, the article did discuss how equities look attractive against depressed bond yields and an elevated risk premium.

Worsening coronavirus trends evident in economic data, select corporate updates:

-	While still somewhat overshadowed by the positive developments on the vaccine front, worsening coronavirus trends in the US and Europe continued to get attention this week. These trends have started to show up in some key economic indicators. Retail sales contracted more than expected in November with signs of softness in a number of holiday shopping categories. In addition, initial claims unexpectedly increased for a second straight week. Both of the regional manufacturing surveys out this week, which provided the first look at December, also came in softer than expected. Updates from some companies in epicenter industries were also downbeat. LUV +0.3% cut its December revenue outlook and said that due to the surge in coronavirus cases, it continues to experience softness in leisure passenger demand and bookings for December, as well as elevated levels of trip cancellations for December travel. DRI +3.1% highlighted a deterioration in comp trends in recent weeks and guided well below the Street for the February Q. EAT +3.4% also reported worsening comp trends and pulled guidance due to coronavirus uncertainty.

S&amp;P 500 Sector Performance:

-	Outperformers: Tech +3.20%, Consumer Disc. +2.32%, Materials +1.92%
-	Underperformers: Energy (4.26%), Communications Svcs. (0.46%), Industrials +0.07%, Utilities +0.07%, Financials +0.12%, REITs +0.35%, Consumer Spls. +0.77%, Healthcare +1.09%
